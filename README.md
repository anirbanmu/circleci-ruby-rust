Docker images that include Ruby & Rust for testing on CircleCI. Originally set up to test Ruby gems which have a Rust native component. The images are extremely simple, i.e. they just add a Rust toolchain on top on CircleCI's Ruby images. Tags & naming should be self explanatory.

Built images are available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/anirbanmu/circleci-ruby-rust/).
